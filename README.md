# Weekly Challenge #18 - VC Simulator

**For this challenge, you need to implement a simulation of many different startups (valuation, raising money, getting acquired, dying) and being able to play a Venture Capitalist that invests in some of them and tracking the returns of their fund.** The finance world is all about modeling the real world in a computer and taking real world actions based on this model. Hopefully this challenge can give a taste of that process.
